A light-weight compression algorithm.  It is designed for speed of
compression and decompression, rather than for the utmost in space
savings.

For getting better compression ratios when you are compressing data
with long repeated sequences or compressing data that is similar to
other data, while still compressing fast, you might look at first
using BMDiff and then compressing the output of BMDiff with
Snappy.
